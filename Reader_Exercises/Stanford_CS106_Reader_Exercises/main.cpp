//  Stanford CS106B: Programming Abstractions
//  <http://see.stanford.edu/see/courseInfo.aspx?coll=11f4f422-5670-4b4c-889c-008262e09e4e>
//
//  The xcode project will include my code solutions to all the exercises included in the 
//  the course reader--Programming Abstractions in C++ (Chapters 1â€“13) by Eric S. Roberts.
//  I am working from a draft edition downloaded from 
//  <http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs106b/materials/CS106B-Reader-Draft.pdf>
//  
//  Each chapter's excersices are coded in their own file(s), e.g., exercisesCh01.cpp.
//  main.cpp will be updated to provide an interface to accessing the exercises in each
//  chapter.
//
//  I have chosen this somewhat unusual and perhaps inconvenient scheme in order to help me
//  learn how to manage a complex code base.
